And if it follows the same rule book for this near top-spec, seven seater, diesel manual version, this should make for a very good buy indeed! And we say that because, be it features, space, comfort, safety, or even performance, the XUV manages to deliver on all fronts with aplomb."

The engine in question here is the 2.2-litre, four cylinder diesel. It uses an aluminium construction, makes near 185bhp, and develops an impressive 420Nm of peak torque. It also weighs under 200kg.  On the road, it’s endearing to say the least. The way it carries the near 1700kg Mean Metal Motors Azani is remarkable. It never seems to struggle no matter what the rpm. You floor it, it goes. And when it nears the 2000rpm mark, with the turbo spinning like a top in hyperdrive, it transforms the XUV into a hard charging bull.  The 100kmph mark comes and goes in no time. Overtakes are as easy as flicking on a switch. And it takes restraint on one’s part to keep things within the speed limits. "

There’s enough elbow room at the front for two passengers; seating three at the back is a breeze; and though the last row isn’t exactly very comfortable to be in, it works alright in a pinch. However, the second row doesn’t slide, so one can’t play with the available room in the last row. And, getting in and out of the last row in the XUV is a chore.  "

It’s also the only SUV in its class to offer ADAS, seven airbags, and in fact, dual zone climate control. Our T trim, gets the ‘courtesy entry’ feature as well, which we love. It pushes the driver’s seat back a bit every time you turn off the car to make getting in and out easier. The seat themselves are electrically adjustable and have memory function.

One of the longest running name plates for the German automaker, it is literally the blueprint of how to combine luxury with ruggedness and has been in production for over 70 years now.<br/><br/>We in India will get the G-Class in the form of the G63 AMG. The previous iteration of this car came to India in 2013 and this one will be launched here on October 5. The boxy lines have been retained as has been the large engine line up, albeit with subtle hints of the modern Mercedes language to bring this iconic vehicle to the modern generation.<br/><br/>Although the new G-Class looks strikingly familiar on the outside, a closer inspection reveals subtle updates that give it a more refined look, without shedding any of its rugged appeal. It is just as boxy and tall as the outgoing car. This trend extends to the interior design too, where the updates make the cabin look more contemporary.<br/><br/>Mercedes has fitted the G63 with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. In the AMG state of tune, the G63 produces 577bhp 850 Nm of torque. And it’s not just a power bump. Fuel efficiency goes up too, thanks to cylinder deactivation technology and the addition of a 9-speed automatic instead of the outgoing model's 7-speed. The new G63 is also considerably lighter than its predecessor, though a final figure hasn't been announced.<br/><br/>It has a 0-100kmph time of 4.4 seconds and will go on to hit a top speed of almost 240kmph. AMG has also significantly enhanced the suspension and the design of the G63, which is also helped along by the new G-Class's independent double wishbone suspension at the front and five-link setup at the rear. The G63 also sports adaptive dampers and coil springs at each corner. It also has additional transverse stabilizers at both ends to reduce body roll.<br/><br/>We expect that Mercedes-Benz will price the G63 around Rs 2 crore. It will take on the likes of the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Lamborghini Urus, BMW X5 M and the Range Rover Sport."

So, that’s one of the biggest buying criteria among new car buyers checked off the list.

The things we liked from the get go includes the steering, the ride, and how adjustable it is around corners. The steering is reasonably quick. It doesn’t feel artificial in its feedback, return-ability, or heft. And there’s a linearity and predictability in the how the Slavia’s front responds to steering inputs.

Now, the 1-litre TSI can feel a little gruff and a tad noisy, it’s more than up to the job of giving the Slavia the legs to take on both city and highway duties. In terms of pricing, a starting price of 10.5 lakh would be fair. Something under 10 lakh would be fantastic!
